## Movement
 - Stepper motor Nema11 planetary (1:5 gear ratio)
 - 28BYJ48 unipolar motor ([modified into a bipolar motor] http://www.jangeox.be/2013/10/change-unipolar-28byj-48-to-bipolar.html )
 - Linear rail with carrige (L = 100mm)
 - Sliding rods (stainles steel, fi 3mm)
 - Brass spindle (M5x0.5mm, L = 90mm)
 - NUT: 3D printed 100% infill ABS block (28x28x55mm)

## Thermoregulation
 - Thermistor (read how to calibrate your own thermistor in the Calibration section)
 - 40W ceramic heater for 3D printers
 - 24V DC power supply
 - In our iteration we used PID thermoregulation algorithm (parameters need to be tuned by the user, depending on the control setup).
