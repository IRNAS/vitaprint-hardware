# Extruder calibration
To ensure the stepper movement translates into the piston movement accordingly to the g-code, it needs to be calibrated properly.

## Calibration set-up
In principle, the calibration set-up requires:
- CNC control of the piston powering motor (we use Nema 11 with a planetary reductor)
- the assembled extruder (at least the moving parts)
- a precise displacement measurement device (calipers, etc., high precision indicators are preferrable)

The calibration protocol requires a set-up, where the piston translation, can be precisely measured in the axis of extrusion. For this purpose, the measurement device is fixed on the extruder in a way, that the extruder movement is translated directly into the measurement.
