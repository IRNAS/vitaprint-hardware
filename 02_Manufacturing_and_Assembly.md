## 1 Overview and Toolset <a id="OVER"></a>
Here you can find manufacturing and assembly details for one Vitaprint unit. In this repository you can find STEP files for the Vitaprint unit in both orientations - Left and Right. The procedure is the same for both orientations (the final product is only mirrored) therefore you will find details for assembly for one unit in this repository.

## 3 Assembly Details <a id="ASSEMBLY"></a>

 - manufacture all parts
 - assemble each section separately
 - Use philips DIN965 screws wherever you see the hole chamfers, use torx BN6404 screws elsewhere
 - for the following steps gently apply hammer:
   - sliding the ball bearing into the rod holder
   - sliding the M5 threaded rod into the coupler
